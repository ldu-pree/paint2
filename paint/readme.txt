compile the program with "make"
then run it with ./paint height width pixel-size
like: ./paint 500 500 2
^^^^^this wil create a 500 by 500 pixel screen with each paintable pixel being 2 by 2
then either click on the screen where you want to start or just start at default location

to print use arrow keys or either click which pixel you want to colour

to make it print while holding in an arrow key press f10 while holding FN button
