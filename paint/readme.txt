compile the program with "make re"
then run it with ./a.out height width pixel-size File-name
like: ./paint 500 500 10 test.txt
^^^^^this wil create a 500 by 500 pixel screen with each paintable pixel being 10 by 10 and it will save into test.txt
then either click on the screen where you want to start or just start at default location

to print use arrow keys or either click which pixel you want to colour
