compile the program with "make re"
then run it with either:
./a.out height width pixel-size File-name
^^^^This will create a new file^^^^^
./a.out File-name Pixel-Size
^^^This will open a saved file^^^^^
like: ./a.out 500 500 10 test.txt
or
like: ./a.out test.txt 10
^^^^^this wil create a 500 by 500 pixel screen with each paintable pixel being 10 by 10 and it will save into test.txt
then either click on the screen where you want to start or just start at default location

to print use arrow keys or either click which pixel you want to colour
